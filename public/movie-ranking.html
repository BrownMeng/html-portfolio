<h1>The Best Movies According to Matt</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>fantastic trilogy of films, that i would recommend watching in succession as it is a continuopus retelling of the narrative of the books published by J.R.R Tolkien <br> However, be warned the extended editions are very long and can take a whole day to watch. so either plan ahead or prepare alot of snacks and get cosy</p>
<h3>Big Hero 6</h3>
<p>An animated film adaptation of a long standing comic series, in which deviates from the standard productions made by disney, personally one of my favourites due to Baymax</p>
<h3>Pursuit of Happiness</h3>
<p>A heartwrenching story telling the events of a man trying to make his way in life and support his family, with the portrayal of the main character being played by Will Smith</p>
